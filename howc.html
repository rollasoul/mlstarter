<br>
<h3>AI</h3> <p>very broad term for a range of very different approaches e.g. knowledge based learning, <br>
computer is hard-coded/provided with knowledge by humans in a formal language, <br>
via logical rules it tries to deprive meaning from text; <br>  
<i>problem</i> of complexity to describe the world in formal language, <br> 
<i>problem</i> of humans as knowledge source rather than world itself</p>
<br>
<h3>Machine Learning</h3> <p>broad term for learning by extracting patterns from raw data,<br>
e.g. providing machine with features of what you want the machine to learn;<br>
human feature would be nose, <i>problem</i> of pixel values in images, shadows/obstructions, quality â€¦<br></p>
<br>
<h3>Representation Learning</h3> <p>relatively defined term for a network that looks at representation itself, <br>
designs features for itself (much faster than humans, organic/natural learning approach)<br>
<i>problem</i> of complexity/multidimensionality of certain features like accent of human voice or edges</p>
<br>
<h3>Deep Learning</h3> <p>very specific term for a network that combines simpler concepts of representations like corners,<br> contours to more complex ones like object parts (see <a href="howw.html" target="_self">HOW IT WORKS</a>"-illustration)</p>
<br>
<h3>Main Types of Neural Networks:</h3><p>NNs, CNNs, RNNs, DCGANs, LSTMs, autoencoders </p>
