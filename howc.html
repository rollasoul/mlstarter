<h3>AI</h3> <p>-> very broad term for a range of very different approaches e.g. knowledge based learning, <br>
computer is hard-coded/provided with knowledge by humans in a formal language, <br>
via logical rules it tries to deprive meaning from text; <br>  
problem of complexity to describe the world in formal language, <br> 
problem of humans as knowledge source rather than world itself</p>

<h3>Machine Learning<h3/> <p>-> broad term for learning by extracting patterns from raw data, <br>
e.g. providing machine with features of what you want the machine to learn; <br>
human -> feature is nose, problem of pixel values in images, shadows/obstructions, quality â€¦<br></p>

<h3>Representation Learning</h3> <p>-> relatively defined term for a network that looks at representation itself, designs features for itself (much faster than humans, organic/natural learning approach)</p>

<h3>Deep Learning</h3> <p>-> very specific term for </p>

<h3>Types of Neural Networks:</h3><p> NNs, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, autoencoders </p>
