<p>-> baby learns to walk, clear feedback from environment of the correct outcome<br/>  
(unclear how to get there, so baby has to figure it out on its own, doesnâ€™t really understand you)</p>
<p>We guess, we try, we observe, we react to reality 
(adjusting our actions towards our environment)</p>
<p>Computers and humans are different:</p>
<p>* some tasks simple for computers, some complicated (calculation, face recognition)</p>
<p>* some tasks simple for humans, some complicated (face recognition, calculation)</p>
<p>Two major ways of engaging with a situation:</p>
<p>analytical(understand problem, analyse then do) vs creative (tweak a high scoring solution)</p>
<p>-> linear vs parallel, calculation vs iteration, machine vs human</p>
