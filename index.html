<h2> MACHINE LEARNING, NEURAL NETWORKS & AI - INTRO</h2>

<h3>WHY WE SHOULD CARE</h3>
<p>Machine learning is about artificiality, about consciousness and ultimately about ourselves.</p>
<h3>HOW WE LEARN</h3>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VLq3kV55ESw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>">
<p>-> baby learns to walk, clear feedback from environment of the correct outcome (unclear how to get there, so baby has to figure it out on its own, doesn’t really understand you)</p>
<p>We guess, we try, we observe, we react to reality (adjusting our actions towards our environment)</p>
<p>Computers and humans are different:</p>
<p>* some tasks simple for computers, some complicated (calculation, face recognition)</p>
<p>* some tasks simple for humans, some complicated (face recognition, calculation)</p>
<p>Two major ways of engaging with a situation:</p>
<p>analytical(understand problem, analyse then do) vs creative (tweak a high scoring solution)</p>
<p>-> linear vs parallel, calculation vs iteration, machine vs human</p>

<h3>How a Neural Network Learns</h3>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V1eYniJ0Rnk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>-> computer learns to play game, clear feedback from environment of the correct outcome, score has to be raised (unclear how to get there, so computer has to figure it out on its own, doesn’t understand anything in beginning)</p>
<p>-> Machine Learning is applying principles of human/organic learning to computers</p>
<p><i>
"The difficulties faced by systems relying on hard-coded knowledge suggest
that AI systems need the ability to acquire their own knowledge, by extracting
patterns from raw data." (deeplearningbook, page 2)</i></p>

<p>useful terminology </p> 
<p>simple/multiple linear classifiers</p>
<p>error (is guide not clean calculation, correct value - calculated value)</p>
<p>learning rate</p>
