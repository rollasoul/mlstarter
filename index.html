<p>Pygmalion & Galatea: Pygmalion breathed life into his beloed statue (later named Galatea), married her and had children with her

Machine Learning, Neural Networks and “AI” - brief introduction

Why We Should Care
Machine learning is about artificiality, about consciousness and ultimately about ourselves. 

How We Learn 

Watch: Baby learns to walk
-> baby learns to walk, clear feedback from environment of the correct outcome (unclear how to get there, so baby has to figure it out on its own, doesn’t really understand you)

We guess, we try, we observe, we react to reality (adjusting our actions towards our environment) 

Computers and humans are different:
* some tasks simple for computers, some complicated (calculation, face recognition)
* some tasks simple for humans, some complicated (face recognition, calculation)

Two major ways of engaging with a situation: 
analytical(understand problem, analyse then do) vs creative (tweak a high scoring solution)
-> linear vs parallel, calculation vs iteration, machine vs human</>p
