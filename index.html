<h2> MACHINE LEARNING, NEURAL NETWORKS & AI - INTRO</h2>

<h3>WHY WE SHOULD CARE</h3>
<p>Machine learning is about artificiality, about consciousness and ultimately about ourselves.</p>
<h3>HOW WE LEARN</h3>
<p>Watch: Baby learns to walk</a></p>

<p>-> baby learns to walk, clear feedback from environment of the correct outcome (unclear how to get there, so baby has to figure it out on its own, doesnâ€™t really understand you)</p>
<p>We guess, we try, we observe, we react to reality (adjusting our actions towards our environment)</p>
<p>Computers and humans are different:</p>
<p>* some tasks simple for computers, some complicated (calculation, face recognition)</p>
<p>* some tasks simple for humans, some complicated (face recognition, calculation)</p>
<p>Two major ways of engaging with a situation:</p>
<p>analytical(understand problem, analyse then do) vs creative (tweak a high scoring solution)</p>
<p>-> linear vs parallel, calculation vs iteration, machine vs human</p>
