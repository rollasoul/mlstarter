<p>-> computer learns to play game, clear feedback from environment of the correct outcome, score has to be raised (unclear how to get there, so computer has to figure it out on its own, doesnâ€™t understand anything in beginning)</p>
<p>-> Machine Learning is applying principles of human/organic learning to computers</p>
<p><i>
"The difficulties faced by systems relying on hard-coded knowledge suggest
that AI systems need the ability to acquire their own knowledge, by extracting
patterns from raw data." (deeplearningbook, page 2)</i></p>

<p>useful terminology </p> 
<p>simple/multiple linear classifiers</p>
<p>error (is guide not clean calculation, correct value - calculated value)</p>
<p>learning rate</p>
