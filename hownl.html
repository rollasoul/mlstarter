<p>-> computer learns to play game, clear feedback from environment of the correct outcome, score has to be raised<br/>  
(unclear how to get there, so computer has to figure it out on its own, doesnâ€™t understand anything in beginning)</p>
<p>-> Machine Learning is applying basic principles of human/organic learning to computers</p>
<p><i>
"The difficulties faced by systems relying on hard-coded knowledge suggest<br/> 
that AI systems need the ability to acquire their own knowledge, by extracting<br/> 
patterns from raw data." (deeplearningbook, page 2)</i></p>

<p>related terminology in machine learning:</p> 
<p><i>treshold</i></p>
<p><i>learning rate</i></p>
<p><i>error</i></p>
<p><i>weight</i></p>
<p><i>unsupervised vs supervised learning</i></p>
